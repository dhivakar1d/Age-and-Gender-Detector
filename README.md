# Age-and-Gender-Detector
This project uses pre-trained deep learning models to perform real-time age and gender prediction from images or webcam input, built with OpenCV’s DNN module.

## Features

- Detects gender: Male or Female
- Estimates age range (e.g., 25–32)
- Uses OpenCV's DNN module and pre-trained Caffe models
- Real-time webcam support or image-based detection

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Age_Gender_Detector.git
   cd Age_Gender_Detector
   
#Install required packages:
pip install opencv-python numpy

Usage
Detect age and gender from an image:
python detect.py --image example.jpg

For real-time detection using your webcam:
python detect.py --webcam

Example Output
Detected: Female, Age: 25-32

Models Used
Age Detection: age_net.caffemodel (trained on Adience dataset)
Gender Detection: gender_net.caffemodel
